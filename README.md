Mule Module Buffer Aggregator
=============================

This module allows to buffer the payloads of the incoming messages and send them as an aggregated message when the buffer reaches the maximum threshold or is flushed.
It is possible to crete groups which will act as separate buffers.
When a buffer is flushed the incoming message order is preserved.
