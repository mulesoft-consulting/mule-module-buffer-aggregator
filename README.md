Mule Buffer Aggregator
======================

This module allows to buffer incoming messages and send them as an aggregated collection when the buffer reaches the maximum size or is flushed.
It is possible to crete aggregation groups which will act as separate buffers.
When the buffer is flushed the incoming message order is preserved.
